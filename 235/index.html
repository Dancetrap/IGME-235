        <h2>About Hugo Serinese</h2>
        <p>Hugo Serinese is a second year at the Rochester Institution of Technology taking a New Media Interactive Design major. He likes to play video games, include the Just Dance Franchise and being on the computer. Currently, he's taking IGME 235 because he wants to learn how to make a website for some of his future projects. He's not so sure what he wants to do for the future, but he's clear on one thing. He's putting every second of his time in doing the right thing, doing his best, and making everyone happy, including himself.</p>
